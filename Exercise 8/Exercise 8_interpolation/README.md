## Analysis of SMI in relation to precipitation and NDVI in 13 counties of interest (North Rhine-Westphalia) in 2018

Droughts are one of the most devastating natural disasters, affecting agriculture, the environment, and the country's social and economic activity. 
Droughts have occurred as a result of insufficient precipitation and extremely dry weather. 
This study aims to provide thorough insights into the Soil Moisture Index (SMI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Precipitation in 
the 13 counties of the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia from 16 May to 16 August 2018. Furthermore, the secondary goal of this study is
to determine the significant differences in SMI between the counties of Olpe (OE) and Hochsauerlandkreis (HSK). Various tools and technologies, such 
as QGIS and the Python programming language, are used to conduct this investigation. The data is downloaded from the German Weather Service (DWD) 
website using Python scripts and the data is analysed using several libraries. The investigation result reveals that precipitation might be considered 
one of the key factors that have an impact on SMI. Moreover, the results also show that there is no influence of altitude on SMI. The findings also reveal
that altitude has no impact on SMI. In addition, the water raining on the roofs of the buildings to be drained in the Olpe area is being investigated. 
Buildings are geo-referenced, and the area of the buildings is calculated using QGIS software, which improves the measurement of water drainage from roofs.
